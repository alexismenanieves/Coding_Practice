## README

This project contains a notebook with exercises in python. Some of the lessons I learned were:

- There are many ways to accomplish a goal in Python
- It is quite useful to write with mathematical notation
- Type hints are preferable [1]. I'll try to make the needed changes to this
- Some coding was made with functional programming style. It's not so "pythonic" 
but I think is useful [2]
